## Getting Started
If you want to start to use the calculator, you must insert inside the text area a complex number in cartesian notation, or using the keyboard and than press enter, or using the bottons present on the interface and than press "=". Than the number is shown in the stack table, in this way it is possible to continue performing the operations on the numbers present in the stack (For the operation that require two operands it's necessary that the stack has at least two elements).

## Features
 • It is possible to enter complex numbers in the format a + bj.
 
 • The operations supported on complex numbers are +, -, *, /, sqrt to calculate the root, + - which reverses the sign, mod to calculate the modulus, arg to
   calculate the argument, exp to calculate the exponential, log to calculate the natural logarithm, sin for the sine, cos for the cos, tan for the tangent.
   
 • It is possible to operate on the stack, including: drop, which removes the element in the dup stack, which makes a copy of the last element
   stack, swap, which \ n swaps the last two elements of the stack; above what a copy of the penultimate element of the stack; or you can type the
   clear command to delete all elements from the stack.
   
 • By clicking the inv key, it is also possible to take advantage of the inverse trigonometric functions
 
 • '> x' to insert the value at the top of the stack into the variable.
 
 • '<x' to insert the value into the variable at the top of the stack.
 
 • '+ x' to add the value at the top of the stack to the variable.
 
 • '-x' to subtract the value at the top of the stack from the variable.
 
 • By pressing the Expand key you can enter programmable operations.
 
 • To insert programmable operations it is necessary to define \ n a name and a list of operations separated by a space.
 
 • The programmable operations can be removed by typing the name of the operation to be deleted and clicking on the remove button or by selecting an operation
   from the table and right clicking.
 
 • The programmable operations can be modified by typing the name of the operation to be deleted and clicking on the modify button or by double clicking on
   an operation directly from the table.
