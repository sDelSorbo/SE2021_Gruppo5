# About The Project ✌
The application is a scientific programmable calculator that can handle complex number and a series of operations on them. The application shows a modern GUI to insert and compute operation on Numbers.

 <p id=technology>
 </p>
 
# Technology 🚨
The Scientific Programmable Calculator is built using:
- Java 1.8.0
- JavaFX 2
- Scen Builder 2.0
- JUnit 4.13
 
 <p id=getting-started>
 </p>
 
# Getting Started 👀
To use the calculator clone it from the repository
```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/sDelSorbo/SE2021_Gruppo5
```
and start it using an IDE like Netbeans.
To use it properly check the Techonology used for the application.

# Key Features ✨
 • It is possible to enter complex numbers in the format a + bj using the keyboard or the GUI.
 
 • The operations supported on complex numbers are +, -, *, /, sqrt to calculate the root, +- which reverses the sign, mod to calculate the modulus, arg to calculate the argument, exp to calculate the exponential, log to calculate the natural logarithm, sin for the sine, cos for the cos, tan for the tangent.

 • It is possible to modify the stack using the commands drop, which removes the element in the dup stack, which makes a copy of the last element stack, swap, which \ n swaps the last two elements of the stack; above what a copy of the penultimate element of the stack; or you can type the clear command to delete all elements from the stack.
   
 • By clicking the inv key, it is also possible to take advantage of the inverse trigonometric functions

 • It is possible to use 26 Variables form "a" to "z" 
 
 • '>x' to insert the value at the top of the stack into the variable.
 
 • '<\x' to insert the value into the variable at the top of the stack.
 
 • '+x' to add the value at the top of the stack to the variable.
 
 • '-x' to subtract the value at the top of the stack from the variable.
 
 • By pressing the Expand key you can enter user defined operations.
 
 • User defined operations are defined by a name and a list of instuction separated by a comma. The user can take advantage of all the operations, can put a number in the stack, or save and restore the variables.
 
 • The User defined operations can be removed by typing the name of the operation to be deleted and clicking on the remove button or by selecting an operation from the table and right clicking.
 
 • The programmable operations can be modified by typing the name of the operation to be deleted and clicking on the modify button or by double clicking on an operation directly from the table.

 • The user can save the User Defined Operations by clicking on the export button in file bar and choose to export them in CSV format or Dat Format

 • The user can save the variables stored entering the "save" command or using the menu in the file bar.

 • The user can restore the variables in the variable stack entering the "restore" command or using the menu in the file bar.

# Demo 📈
If you want to start to use the calculator, you must insert inside the text area a complex number in cartesian notation, or using the keyboard and than press enter, or using the bottons present on the interface and than press "=". Than the number is shown in the stack table, in this way it is possible to continue performing the operations on the numbers present in the stack (For the operation that require two operands it's necessary that the stack has at least two elements).

  </p>

Clicking on the extend button, the calculator shows the section to define the customize operations.

In the menu bar into the File menu, there is the possibility to export or import the user defined operations, in order to save and restore new and old operations.
